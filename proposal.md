Final Project Proposal:

**The Big Idea:**
My project is a Personal Expense Tracker that helps users log, categorize, and visualize their daily spending. Users will be able to input expenses such as food, transportation, or entertainment and see how much they spend in each category over time. 

Minimum Viable Product (MVP)
- Allow users to add and view expenses.
- Store expense data in a CSV or JSON file.
- Display total and average spending by category.

Stretch Goal:
- Add a simple web interface using Flask.
- Create charts or graphs (e.x., using `matplotlib`) to visualize spending trends.
- Allow users to filter by date or category.

Python Topics and Concepts Explored:
- Functions: to organize code for adding, viewing, and summarizing expenses.  
- I/O programming: to save and load data from CSV or JSON files.  
- Data structures: using lists, dictionaries, and tuples to store expense records.  
- Loops and conditionals: to process user input and perform calculations.  

These topics will strengthen my understanding of core Python programming while also providing hands-on experience with a topic that is personally relatable and relevant to many peers. 

**Learning Objectives:**
- Improve Python skills and confidence in coding fundamentals.
- Explore how Flask can turn a Python script into a basic web app.
- Have a working model to put in my portfolio for recruiting

**Implementation Plan:**
I will start by creating a simple command-line version of the app and later explore adding a web interface.

Plan:
1. Data storage – use CSV or JSON to store user inputs (date, category, amount, note)
2. Input and output – create Python functions to add, read, and summarize expenses
3. Visualization (stretch) – use `matplotlib` to generate charts
4. Web integration – experiment with Flask to display data in a browser

I will watch tutorials and read documentation on these tools to understand how to use them.

**Project Schedule:**
**Week 1 (Nov 9–15):  
- Finalize idea and design program structure.  
- Create data storage format and basic input/output in Python.

Week 2 (Nov 16–22):  
- Add functions to calculate totals and summaries.  
- Test CSV/JSON read and write features.

Week 3 (Nov 23–Nov 29): 
- Implement visualization features (bar charts or pie charts).  
- Begin styling and formatting output.

Week 4 (Nov 30–Dec 5):
- Integrate Flask web interface.  
- Final testing, debugging, and polish.

**Collaboration Plan:**
Since I am working alone, I don't have a collaboartive structure but will be holding myself accountable to these deadlines and checking in every weekend to ensure my week's progress is on track. 

**Risks and Limitations:** 
The main risk is limited experience with Python and external libraries. I may face many challenges reading/writing files correctly or connecting Flask. To manage this, I’ll start small and ensure the core functionality works before adding extra features. I will do this project in iterations to ensure small but accruate improvements.I will also rely on online documentation and small tutorials to guide me.

**Additional Course Content:**
- More ways to visualize outputs given by a user 
- HTML usage to make a platform for users
